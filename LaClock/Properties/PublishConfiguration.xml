	<LongDescription>
    This mod displays the current system time in the toolbar.

    ### Features

    - Toolbar clock displaying system time
    - Customizable display format

    ### Motivation

    Since the wonderful ssharp0 haven't updated their [System Clock Mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/107257/Windows),
    (which has been broken by CSL2's 1.3.6f1 update,)
    I figured maybe I can put together a replacement so I don't lose track of time ever so often.
    I rewrote the codebase because I couldn't be bothered to read through the so-very-long GPL-v3 license...
    (and also the hope of this being a great learning opportunity).

    So, welcome to mt first experimental mod for Cities: Skylines II,
    which is also my first C#/React/TypeScript project.
    Enjoy! (And hopefully it won't break anyone's saves.
    I mean, I don't see how it could, but then again I am a total noob to modding.
    As a general precaution, always **backup your saves**.)
