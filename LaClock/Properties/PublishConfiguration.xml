**This mod displays the current system time in the toolbar.**

### Features

- Toolbar clock displaying system time
- Customizable display format
- Option to making the clock blink every hour (require enabling in the settings)

### Motivation

Since the wonderful [System Clock Mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/107257/Windows)
hasn't been updated for 1.3.6f1,
I figured maybe I can put together a replacement so I don't lose track of time ever so often.
So, welcome to my first experimental mod for Cities: Skylines II,
which is also my first C#/React/TypeScript project.

Enjoy!

(As a general precaution when using mods, remember to **always backup your saves**.)
