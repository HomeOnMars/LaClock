LaClock Mod Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This mod displays the current system time in the toolbar.

### Features

- Toolbar clock displaying system time
- Customizable display format

### Motivation

Since the wonderful [System Clock Mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/107257/Windows)
hasn't yet been updated for 1.3.6f1,
I figured maybe I can put together a replacement so I don't lose track of time ever so often.
So, welcome to my first experimental mod for Cities: Skylines II,
which is also my first C#/React/TypeScript project.

Enjoy!

(Remember, as a general precaution when using mods, always **backup your saves**.)
