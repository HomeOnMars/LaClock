# LaClock

> If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.

Welcome to an experimental mod for Cities: Skylines II,
where I try to write a mod to put a clock in the game,
so I don't lose track of time as often.

This is my first CSL2 Mod!
I am hoping this will be a helpful learning experiences on CSL2 modding.
